## Creative urban mapping

Through our research into creative mapping we have found that what distinguishes the creative map from traditional cartography is how it highlights the subjective and embodied experience of the map maker.  Creative maps offer new spatial insight by placing an emphasis on how spaces are actually experienced.

Using creative mapping methods our projects layer personal experience on to urban spaces which hold interest for us. Our recent projects have explored an iconic urban football stadium, and the urban public realm from the perspective of teenagers.  Take a look at those projects below.
