## About this project

**Dalymount Park: Mapping a Unique Architectural Space** is a collaborative mapping project developed by Jackie Bourke and Dorothy Smith. It was funded through The Arts Council of Ireland, Engaging with Architecture Scheme.

Dalymount Park is an iconic football stadium in Phibsborough, Dublin. Originally built in 1901 Dalymount has since been in an almost constant state of flux, through adaptations, new additions, and general wear and tear. Today it is a haphazard mix of structures and detail. Under city development plans it will soon be knocked and a new municipal stadium built in its place. The project has captured a moment in time, a range of memories and strong emotional attachments. Using photography, interviews and drawing we mapped out the architectural heritage and everyday experience of this space. The project comprises **Drawing Dalymount: The Colouring Book** which is a playful book of drawings made by workshop participants, and **Dalymount: Bigger Than The Game**, a projection of photographs and interviews with people who have rich associations with the space.

## Drawing Dalymount: The Colouring Book

Dalymount Park, home to Bohemians Football Club for over 100 years, is located in the urban village of Phibsborough, north Dublin. On a cold wet Saturday morning in November 2018, over 40 people gathered in Dalymount Park to draw the architecture of this unique space. They were children and adults, professional artists, and those who had not drawn for years. Some had close ties with the club, others had never entered the stadium.

The drawing day was facilitated by Dorothy Smith and Jackie Bourke. Drawing Dalymount: The Colouring Book comprises a series of drawings produced that day. It marks a moment in the stadium's evolution from the perspective of a diverse group of people. 

Spaces like Dalymount Park are important in a city; look carefully and you will find a fascinating architectural diversity,  socio-cultural history, and place attachment. Dalymount Park is a site which holds generations of memories rooted in it's haphazard mix of structures and places. The drawings in the book reflect that complexity, breathing new life in to the architecture of the stadium and the many stories it has to tell. You can flick through a copy here:
