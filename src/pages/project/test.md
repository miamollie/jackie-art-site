#### Spatial Stories - An Exploration of Young People's Everyday Experience of Public Space 

This project maps out the urban public realm from the perspective of teenagers. Six young people aged 16 and 17 participated in the project. Using photography, mapping techniques, drawing and creative writing, they captured the fleeting moments and subtle details that shape their urban experience. 

Through their work they reveal a complex experience of vulnerability, alienation and a sense of belonging. They map out their innate playfulness, an acute awareness of architectural detail, of nature, of environmental neglect, and the important role of family and friends in their everyday lives.
